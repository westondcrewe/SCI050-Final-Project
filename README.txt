Hi, Prod. Dodds!
Welcome to my project, the Image Player!
The main files to pay any attention to are:
    project_main.ipynb
    functions.py 
    project_image.JPG
    swfaith.wav
    project_drums.wav
And if they are able to work for your machine (they don't for mine as you know):
    sunsleeper.wav
    Satisfaction.wav
Other files/folders within this notebook involve abandoned visualization tasks that I thought would be fun to make.
