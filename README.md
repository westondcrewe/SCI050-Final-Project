# SCI050-Final-Project

<h2>Project for SCI050 Computing for Discovery</h2>

Project aims to create an "Image Player" that will pull audio out of a PNG image through Least Significant Bit [Desteganographization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography).
Stretch goal of the project is to pipe resulting audio file to a song classification program that would leverage a [reverse engineered Shazam API](https://github.com/shazamio/ShazamIO) to determine whether a real song was hidden within the inputted image. 

Code is also provided to embed audio files within image files (steganographizing).
